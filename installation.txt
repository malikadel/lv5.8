Installation of laravel 5.8 on a freshly installed machine.

composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel lv58 "5.8.*"

It was returning errors so I have to do following.

Install composer

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install php-mbstring 

sudo apt install php-xml

serivce apache2 restart

Then remove lv58

again

composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel lv58 "5.8.*"

sudo chmod 0777 -R storage

.....


To get available composer commands, run 

composer

above will list all existing commands of composer.

php artisan serve

by default it try to run on 

http://127.0.0.1:8000 but if on your machine vm or anything on 8000 running then it moves to

http://127.0.0.1:8001
